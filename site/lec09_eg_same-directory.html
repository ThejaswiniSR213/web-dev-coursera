	<h1>Lorem Ipsum: A History</h1>
	<h3>The first paragraph of this ancient text goes as follows:</h3>
	<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam ut risus eu felis finibus vulputate non vitae lacus. Sed libero dui, feugiat nec posuere a, tincidunt vitae odio. Praesent non nisi et diam iaculis molestie at sit amet enim. Etiam in molestie nisl. Sed imperdiet fringilla dui non tincidunt. Praesent arcu justo, dapibus in finibus sed, viverra in ex. Sed tristique fermentum diam, vitae lacinia sem dignissim vulputate. Nam laoreet magna velit, ac euismod odio dictum ut. Mauris efficitur nibh vitae semper auctor. Etiam ullamcorper interdum neque, et malesuada lacus pretium et. Ut sed nisi sed elit aliquam lacinia. Curabitur est lectus, lacinia quis turpis non, accumsan viverra eros. Proin ac sagittis ligula. Proin blandit consectetur fringilla.</p><br>

    <h3>This roughly translates to the following text:</h3>
	<p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p><br>
