		<h3><b><u>Gen Z doesn’t want to take orders from anybody!</u></b></h3>
		<p>There has been a worldwide upsurge in the number of people taking matters into their own hands and becoming “self-employed”, setting up their small businesses to help make ends meet, and walking away with a sense of freedom, their backs unburdened by the sometimes-crushing weight of meeting expectations and the quota at your regular 9-5. This extremely favorable mindset toward entrepreneurship is the result of a mix of push and pull factors. On the one hand, the traditional path to success in life- education and climbing the corporate ladder—has never felt more elusive or uncertain. At the same time, startup costs are falling, the pool of resources available to entrepreneurs is broadening, and casual entrepreneurship has never been easier.</p>

    </section>

	<section id="section2">

		<p>It isn’t common knowledge that Gen Z has been our most progressive and entrepreneurial generation thus far, with everything from taking a humanitarian stand during BLM, to protesting against the climate crisis, it’s the children of today whose war cries against conservative societal norms are heard loud and clear. Gen Z was raised by the Millenials (Gen Y), many of whom were either entrepreneurs or had no choice but to slave away at work to meet never-ending deadlines. Either way, the environment Gen Zers grew up in shaped their impressario-esque mindset because they witnessed their parents lead a self-sufficient or demanding lifestyle firsthand and feared for their future. While they could’ve settled on getting a college degree and going on to join a firm and work up the corporate ladder over possibly decades, most of us Gen Zers decided against following our forefather's footsteps and instead opted to venture into the unknown: we decided to take the road not taken and become self-employed, to become self-sufficient and capable of handling our own lives without external pressure.  </p>

	<section id="section3">
		<div><p>For starters, companies and firms don’t just take in any college graduate. These “products” pumped out by universities are made to face the harsh reality of the continuous and tedious cycle we’ve come to know as the “Interview Process”, with round after round dedicated to testing our knowledge, our interpersonal skills, and whatnot.</p></div>

		<p>Even as students, they're faced with the predicament of survival and take up part-time and sometimes full-time minimum wage jobs during summer break in an attempt to earn their keep and gain a sense of independence, but when customers filter through stores throughout the day and some of them forget common courtesy and behave rude to employees, they begin to question if any of this is worth it. If working for 8 hours a day and sometimes pulling double shifts for colleagues is truly worth it, if the inconsiderate conduct of multiple customers they face on an almost daily basis is worth the bare minimum wage.With as much as 32% of the 7.7B that make up the world population comprising purely the Gen Zers, it doesn’t come as a surprise when we hear that almost 53% want to run their own business one day, and 24% have already begun. This shift from a regular 9 to 5 to a more self-employed route is groundbreaking in terms of a progressive global mindset.</p>

	<section id="section4">
		<h3><b><u>What’s so good about running your own business that’s seemed to have caught Gen Z’s eyes?</u></b></h3>
		 Well, here are three reasons why Gen Z thinks so:
		<ul>
			<li><p>Flexibility: The number one reason Gen Zers choose to become self-employed is to gain a sense of control over their destiny. Flexibility and choice contribute significantly to that sense of control. The ability to pick and choose when and where they work. 69% of employees think they’re more productive (by an average of 72%) if they feel that their employer trusts them to get the job done without monitoring their progress.</p></li>

			<li><p>Work/Life Blend: Every self-employed business owner knows that there is almost no distinction between their personal and professional lives. When you're self-employed, work/life balance is a myth; at best, you make work fit into your life rather than the other way around. Gen Zers are doing just that by incorporating their passions into reality, by using the app TikTok to expand their small businesses offering a wide range of services such as custom jewelry making, selling digital prints, and even 3-D printing custom figurines. There is a market for these services and Gen Z is very smart to use the app TikTok to advertise their goods on it and expand their business.</p></li>

			<li><p>Self-fulfillment: Being self-employed allows you to constantly push yourself to your limits and see the tangible results of your labor. Because it is not about the number of hours put in, the outcome is more important than the output. It is about how you feel about yourself, your pride, your accomplishments, and the outcomes you achieve.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3><b><u>How does Gen Z plan to grow their businesses?</u></b></h3>
		<p>Many social networks are extensively used by Gen Zers around the world to connect, consume interactive media, play games, and share information.Snapchat (42.0 million), TikTok (37.3 million), and Instagram have the most monthly Gen Z users (33.3 million). Over the next four years, it is anticipated that these will continue to be the most well-liked among Generation Z.This hierarchy will remain in place until 2025, but the top three platforms will sprout at different rates. TikTok will overtake Instagram to take second place in 2021 and will continue to grow its lead over Snapchat.  Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Reddit have sizable followings as well.</p>

		<section id="section6">
		<p>Gen Z has been our most purpose-driven generation yet. When it comes to running their own businesses and being self-made, Gen Z takes a different approach, with an iron heart and a desire to do good for their customers. The state of small business will continue to change as our world does, but we can anticipate that Gen Z's entrepreneurial and unconventional mindset will drive the industry's future. This is just the start.</p>
